ABSTRACT
The emergence of novel types of communication, such as email, has
been brought on by the development of the internet, which radically
concentrated the way in that individuals communicate socially and
with one another. It is now establishing itself as a crucial aspect of
the communication network which has been adopted by a variety
of commercial enterprises such as retail outlets. So in this research
paper, we have built a unique spam-detection methodology based
on email-body sentiment analysis. The proposed hybrid model is
put into practice and preprocessing the data, extracting the proper-
ties, and categorizing data are all steps in the process. To examine
the emotive and sequential aspects of texts, we use word embed-
ding and a bi-directional LSTM network. this model frequently
shortens the training period, then utilizes the Convolution Layer to
extract text features at a higher level for the BiLSTM network. Our
model performs better than previous versions, with an accuracy
rate of 97–98%. In addition, we show that our model beats not just
some well-known machine learning classifiers but also cutting-edge
methods for identifying spam communications, demonstrating its
superiority on its own. Suggested Ensemble model’s results are
examined in terms of recall, accuracy, and precision

Over the past few years, a clear surge of both the amount of spam-
mers as well as spam emails. This is likely due to a fact that the
investment necessary for engaging in the spamming industry is
relatively low. As a result of this, we currently have a system that
identifies every email as suspicious, which has caused major expen-
ditures in the investment of defense systems [ 12]. Emails are used
for online crimes like fraud, hacking, phishing, E-mail bombing, bul-
lying, and spamming. [ 16]. Algorithms that are based on machine
learning (ML) are now the most effective and often used approach to
the recognition of spam. Phishing, which is defined as a fraudulent
attempt to acquire private information by masquerading as a trust-
worthy party in electronic communication, has rapidly advanced
past use of simple techniques and the tactic of casting a wide net;
instead, spear phishing uses a variety of sophisticated techniques
to target a single high-value individual. Other researchers used NB,
Decision Trees, and SVM to compare the performance of supervised
ML algorithms for spam identification [ 6]. Spam emails clog up re-
cipients’ inboxes with unsolicited communications, which frustrate
them and push them into the attacker’s planned traps [ 7]. As a re-
sult, spam messages unquestionably pose a risk to both email users
and the Internet community. In addition, Users may occasionally
read the entire text of an unsolicited message that is delivered to
the target users’ inboxes without realizing that the message is junk
and then choosing to avoid it. Building a framework for email spam
detection is the aim of this project. In this approach, we combine the
Word-Embedding Network with the CNN layer, Bi-LSTM, and GRU
(BiLSTM+GRU). CNN layers are used to speed up training time
before the Bi-LSTM network, and more advanced textual character-
istics are extracted with the use of this network in comparison to
the straight LSTM network, in less time. Gated recurrent neural net-
works (GRUs) are then added because they train more quickly and
perform better for language modeling. To evaluate and investigate
various machine learning algorithms for predicting email spam,
and develop a hybrid classification algorithm to filter email spam
before employing an ensemble classification algorithm to forecast
it. To put an innovative technique into practice and compare it to
the current method in terms of various metrics. Ensemble learn-
ing, a successful machine learning paradigm, combines a group of
learners rather than a single learner to forecast unknown target
attributes. Bagging, boosting, voting, and stacking are the four main
types of ensemble learning techniques. To increase performance,
an integrated method and the combining of two or three algorithms
are also suggested. Extraction of text-based features takes a long
time. Furthermore, it can be challenging to extract all of the crucial
information from a short text. Over the span associated with this

research, we utilize Bidirectional Large Short-Term Memories (Bi-
LSTM) in conjunction with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
to come up with an innovative method to the detection of spam.
Bagging and boosting approaches were widely preferred in this
study. Contribution and paper organization is as follows: section 1.1
describes literature study, section 1.2 describe motivation for this
research work, section 2 sketches procedure of details implemen-
tation, Section 3 present experimental setup, dataset description
and evaluation metrics, and section 4 summarizing outcomes of the
experiment.
1.1 Related Work
Email is indeed the second most frequently utilized Internet appli-
cation as well as the third most common method of cyberbullying,
claims one study. Cybercriminals exploit it in a number of ways,
including as sending obscene or abusive messages, adding viruses
to emails, snatching the private information of victims, and ex-
posing it to a broad audience. Spam letters made up 53.95% of all
email traffic in March 2020. We examine three main types of un-
lawful emails in our study. First are fake emails, which are sent
to manipulate recipients to submit sensitive information. The sec-
ond as being cyberbullying’s use of harassing emails to threaten
individuals. Suspicious emails that describe illegal activities belong
to the third category. Many researchers have earlier contributed
massively to this subject. The researcher claims there is some proof
that suspicious emails were sent before to the events of 9/11. [ 14].
When it comes to data labeling, there are also convinced rule-based
approaches and technologies ( like VADER) that are used, even
though their efficiency of the are together is adversely affected. A
hidden layer, which itself is essential for vectorization, is the top
layer of the model. We use oversampling methods for this minority
class because of the absence of data. Sampling techniques can help
with multicollinearity, but they have an impact on simulation re-
sults. Oversampling causes data to be randomly repeated, which
affects test data because dividing data may result in duplicates. Un-
dersampling may result in the loss of some strong information. In
order to advance email research, it is crucial to provide datasets on
criminal activity. P. Garg et al. (2021) [ 5], which revealed that spam
in an email was detected in 70 percent of business emails, spam was
established as an obstacle for email administrators. Recognizing
spam and getting rid of it were the primary concerns, as spam can
be offensive, may lead to other internet sites being tricked, which
can offer harmful data, and can feature those who are not particu-
lar with their content using NLP. To select the best-trained model,
each mail transmission protocol requires precise and effective email
classification, a machine learning comparison is done. Our study
has suggested that innovative deep learning outperforms learning
algorithms like SVM and RF. Current studies on the classification
of emails use a variety of machine learning (ML) techniques, with
a few of them focusing on the study of the sentiments consisted of
within email databases. The lack of datasets is a significant obstacle
to email classification. There are few publicly accessible E-mail
datasets, thus researchers must use these datasets to test their hy-
potheses or gather data on their own. Authors[ 15] describe supplied
two-phased outlier detection models to enhance the IIOT network’s
dependability. Artificial Neural Network, SVM, Gaussian NB, andRF (random forest) ensemble techniques were performed to forecast
class labels, and the outputs were input into a classifying unit to
increase accuracy. A method for content-based phishing detection
was presented by the authors in [ 2], to classify phishing emails,
they employed RF. They categorize spam and phishing emails. They
enhanced phishing email classifiers with more accurate predictions
by extracting features. They showed some effective Machine learn-
ing spam filtering techniques. When the PCA method is used, it will
lower the number of features in the dataset. The collected features
go through the PCA algorithm to reduce the number of features.
The PCA method is used to make a straightforward representation
of the information which illustrates the amount of variability there
is in the data. The authors of [ 20] presented the Fuzzy C-means
method for classifying spam email. To stop spam, they implemented
a membership threshold value. A methodology to identify unla-
beled data was put forth by the authors of [ 1] and applied motive
analysis to the Enron data collection. They divided the data into
categories that were favorable, negative, and neutral. They grouped
the data using k-means clustering, an unsupervised ML technique
and then classified it using the supervised ML techniques SVM and
NB. Hina, Maryam, and colleagues (2021) implemented Sefaced:
Deep learning-based semantic analysis and categorization of e-mail
data using a forensic technique. For multiclass email classification,
SeFACED employs a Gated Recurrent Neural Network (GRU) based
on Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). Different random weight ini-
tializations affect LSTMs [ 9]. Zhang, Yan, et al.(2019) Experiments
on three-way game-theoretic rough set (GTRS) email spam filter-
ing show that it is feasible to significantly boost coverage without
decreasing accuracy [ 23]. According to Xia et al. [ 22], SMS spam
has been identified using machine learning model such as naive
bayes , vector-space modeling, support vector machines (SVM),
long selective memory machines (LSTM), and convolutional neural
networks including every instance of a method for categorizing
data. Elshoush, Huwaida, et al. (2019) Using adaboost and stochastic
gradient descent (sgd) algorithms for e-mail filtering with R and
orange software spam [ 3]. Orange software was used to create the
classifications, which included Adaboost and SGD. The majority of
researchers focused on text-based email spam classification meth-
ods because image-based spam can be filtered in the early stages
of pre-processing. There are widely used word bag (BoW) model,
which believes that documents are merely unordered collections
of words, is the foundation for these techniques. Kumaresan [ 11]
explains SVM with a cuckoo search algorithm was used to extract
textual features for spam detection. Renuka and Visalakshi made
use of svm [ 17] spam email identification, followed by selecting
features using Latent Semantic Indexing (LSI). Here we have used
labeled dataset to train the hybrid classifier. We used TF-IDF for
feature extraction [ 20] and Textual features for spam detection
were extracted using SVM and a cuckoo search algorithm. [ 4] for
filtering out the spam email. Combining the integrated strategy to
the pure SVM and NB methods, overall accuracy is really improved.
Moreover, accurate detection for spam email has been proposed
using the Negative Selection Algorithm (NSA) and Particle Swarm
Optimization’s (PSO) algorithm. PSO is used in this instance to
improve the effectiveness of the classifier.

1.2 Motivation and Novelty
Email is most common form of communication between people
in this digital age. Many users have been victims of spam emails,
and their personal information has been compromised. The email
Classification technique is employed to identify and filter junk
mail, junk, and virus-infected emails prior to reach a user’s inbox.
Existing email classification methods result in irrelevant emails
and/or the loss of valuable information. Keeping these constraints
in mind, the following contributions are made in this paper:
•Text-based feature extraction is a lengthy process. Further-
more, extracting every important feature from text is difficult.
In this paper, we show how to employ GRU with Convo-
lutional Neural Networks and Bidirectional-LSTM to find
spam.
•Used Word-Embeddings, BiLSTM, and Gated Recurrent Neu-
ral Networks to examine the relationships, sentimental con-
tent, and sequential way of email contents.
•Applied CNN before the Bi-LSTM network, training time can
be sped up. This network can also extract more advanced
textual features faster than the Bi-LSTM network alone when
combined with the GRU network.
•We use Enorn Corpora datasets and compute precision, re-
call, and f-score to assess how well the suggested technique
performs. Our model outperforms several well-known ma-
chine learning techniques as well as more contemporary
methods for spam message detection.
2 PROPOSED SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE AND
MODEL
E-mail is a valuable tool for communicating with other users. Email
allows the sender to efficiently forward millions of advertisements
at no cost. Unfortunately, this scheme is now being used in a variety
of organizations. As a result, a massive amount of redundant emails
is known as spam or junk mail, many people are confused about the
emails in their E- Mailboxes. Each learning sequence is given for-
ward as well as backward to two different LSTM networks that are
attached to the same outputs layer in order for bidirectional Lstms
to function. This indicates that the Bi-LSTM has detailed sequential
information about all points before and following each point in a
specific sequence. In other words, we concatenate the outputs from
both the forward and the backward LSTM at each time step rather
than just encoding the sequence in the forward direction. Each
word’s encoded form now comprehends the words that come before
and after it. This is a problem for the Internet community. The di-
agram depicts various stages that aid in the prediction of email spam:
Because real-world data is messy and contains unnecessary infor-
mation and duplication, data preprocessing is critical in naturallanguage processing (NLP). The major preprocessing steps are de-
picted below.
2.1 NLP Tokenization
Tokenization of documents into words follows predefined rules.
The tokenization step is carried out in Python with spacy library.
2.2 Stop Words Removal
Stop words appear infrequently or frequently in the document, but
they are less significant in terms of importance. As a result, these
are removed to improve data processing.
2.3 Text Normalization
A word’s lexicon form or order may differ. Thus, they must all be
changed to their root word to be correctly analyzed. Lemmatization
and stemming are the two methods that can be used for normal-
ization. When a word’s final few characters are removed to create
a shorter form, even if that form has no meaning, the procedure
is known as stemming. lemmatization [ 21] is a mixture of corpus-
based an rule-based methods, and it retains the context of a term
while changing it back to its root.
2.4 Feature Extraction
feature extraction which transforms the initial text into its features
so that it may be used for modeling after being cleaned up and
normalized. Before predicting them, we use a specific way to give
weights to specific terms in our document. While it is simple for a
computer to process numbers, we choose to represent individual
words numerically. In such cases, we choose word embeddings. IDF
is the count of documents containing the term divided by the total
number of documents, and occurrence is the amount of instances a
word appears in a document. We derive characteristics based on
equations. 1,2,3,4,5, and 6. We use equations to derive properties.

|𝑑𝜖𝐷𝑡𝜖𝐷|(4)
A word2vec neural network-based approach is the method that is
utilized for this goal as the tool. The following equation, referred
to as 5, shows how word2vec handles word context through the
use of probability-accurate measurements. Here letter D stands for
the paired-wise display of a set of words, while the letters w and c0
or c1 represent paired word context that originated from a larger
collection of set D.

1+𝑒−(𝑤·𝑐0)(6)

2.5 Word-Embeddings
Word-Embedding helps to improve on the typical "bag-of-words"
worldview, which requires a massive sparse feature vector to score
every word individually to represent this same entire vocabulary.
This perception is sparse because the vocabulary is large, and each
word or document is defined by a massive vector. Using a word
map-based dictionary, word embedding needs to be converted terms
(words) into real value feature vectors. There are two basic issues
with standard feature engineering techniques for deep learning.
Data is represented using sparse vectors, and the second is that
some of the meanings of words are not taken into consideration.
Similar phrases will have values in embedding vectors that are
almost real-valued. The Input length in our proposed study is set
to 700 for our suggested model. If the texts seemed to be integer
encoded with value systems between 10 and 20, the vocabulary
distance would be 11. Our data is encoded as integers, and the input
and output dimensions are both set to 50,000. The embedding layer
outcome will be used in successive layers and for BiLSTM and GRU
layers.
2.6 Machine Learning Model
Within the scope of the research, we are using the subsequent ma-
chine learning techniques, to examine and compare the overall
efficacy of our suggested Bi-LSTM strategy: Support Vector Ma-
chine, Gaussian NB, Logistic Regression, K - nearest neighbors, and
Random Forest (RF).
2.7 Convolution Network
The popular RNN model generally performs well but takes too
long to train the model incorporating the textual sequential data.
When a layer is added after the RNN layer, the model’s learning
duration is considerably decreased. Higher-level feature extraction
is another benefit. [ 19] additionally possible using the convolutional
layer. In essence, the convolution layer looks for combinations of
the various words or paragraphs in the document that involve the
filters. We use features with 128 dimensions and a size 10 for each.
For this task, the Relu activation function is utilized. After that, the
one-dimensional largest pooling layers with a pooling size of 4 are
put on the data in order to obtain higher-level features.
2.8 BiLSTM Network with GRU
Recurrent Neural Network (RNN) technique of text sentiment anal-
ysis is particularly well-liked and frequently applied. Recurrent
neural networks (RNN) surpass conventional neural networks. be-
cause it can remember the information from earlier time steps
thanks to its memory. A state vector is combined with an RNN’s
data to create a new state vector. The resulting state vector uses the
present to recollect past knowledge. The RNN is straightforward
and is based on the following equations:
ℎ𝑡=tanh(𝑊ℎℎℎ𝑡−1+𝑊𝜋ℎ𝑥𝑡) (7)
𝑦𝑡=𝑊ℎ𝑦ℎ𝑡 (8)
The vanilla RNN[ 18]is not very good at remembering previous
sequences. In addition to that, RNN struggles with diminishing
gradient descent. A kind of RNN is a long short-term recall network
(LSTM), solves a vanishing gradient descent problem and learnslong-term dependencies[ 10]. LSTM was actually created to address
the problem of long-term reliance. LSTM has the unique ability to
recall. The cell state is the LSTM model’s central concept. With
only a small amount of linear interaction, the cell state follows the
sequence essentially unmodified from beginning to end. gate of
an LSTM is also significant. Under the command of these gates,
information is safely inserted to or eliminated from the cell stated.
The following equations are used by the LSTM model to update
each cell:
𝑓𝑡=𝜎
𝑊𝑓·[ℎ𝑡−1,𝑥𝑡]+𝑏𝑓
(9)
In this case, Xt denotes input, and ht is the hidden state at the t
time step. The following is the revised cell state Ct:
𝑖t=𝜎(𝑊𝑖[ℎ𝑡−1,𝑥𝑡]+𝑏𝑖) (10)
𝐶𝑇=tanh(𝑊𝑐[ℎ𝑡−1,𝑥𝑡]+𝑏𝑐𝑡) (11)
𝐶𝑡=𝑓𝑡∗𝐶𝑡−1+𝑖𝑡∗𝐶𝑇 (12)
Here, we may compute the output and hidden state at t time steps
using the point-wise multiplication operator *.
𝑜𝑡=𝜎(𝑊𝑜·[ℎ𝑡−1,𝑥𝑡]+𝑏𝑜) (13)
ℎ𝑡=𝑜𝑡∗tanh(𝐶𝑡) (14)
Due to the reality it only considers all prior contexts from the
present one, LSTM does have a few drawbacks. As a result of this,
it may accept data from preceding time steps through LSTM as well
as RNN. Therefore, in order to avoid this issue, further improve-
ments are carried out with the help of a bidirectional recurrent
neural network(Bi-RNN). BiRNN [ 13] can handle two pieces of in-
formation from both the front and the back. Bi-LSTM is created
by combining the Bi-RNN and LSTM. As a result, operating LSTM
has advantages such as cell state storage so that BiRNN have way
to acknowledge from the context before and after. As a conse-
quence of this, it provides the Bi-LSTM with the advantages of an
LSTM with feedback for the next layer. Remembering long-term
dependencies is a significant new benefit of Bi-LSTM. The output,
which is a feature vector, will be based on the call state. Finally,
we forecast the probability of email content as Normal, Fraudu-
lent, Harassment, and Suspicious Emails using as an input to the
softmax activation function, which is a weighted sum of the dense
layer’s outputs. To regulate the information flow, GRU employs
the point-wise multiplying function and logistic sigmoid activation.
The GRU has hidden states of storage memory and does not have
distinct memory cells or units for state control. The W, U, and b
vectors, which stand for weights, gates, and biases, respectively, are
crucial variables that must be calculated during the creation of the
GRU model. For training reasons, the pre-trained word embedding
known as the Glove vector is used. They made it clear that GRU
is the superior model when there is a large amount of training
data for textual groups and word embedding is available. BiLSTM,
CNN, and GRU is required so as to compensate for the deletion
of the document’s long-term and short-term connections. In our
case, the embedding dimension, maximum sequence length, and
lexicon size were used to start the LSTM embedding layer in three
separate LSTM models. The input vector was modified to make it
appropriate for such a Conv1D layer, prior situations’ sequences are
returned by LSTM layer. The "return sequences" of the LSTM layer
must be set to False when the subsequent state is free of the gated
184Semantic Analysis and Classification of Emails through Informative Selection of Features and Ensemble AI Model IC3 2023, August 03–05, 2023, Noida, India
architecture. Quantity of learning parameters must be taken into
consideration. A 350-unit LSTM layer was set - up, and different
LSTM unit combinations were tested. More importantly, because
it has more parts, the model made with BiLSTM will take longer
to train. Bidirectional LSTM is the name of a particular kind of
recurrent neural network that is primarily used for the processing
of natural languages. (BiLSTM). It is able to use data from both
sides, and, in contrast to regular LSTM, it enables input flow in
both directions. It is an effective instrument for demonstrating the
logical relationships between words and phrases, and this involves
both the forward and backward directions of the sequence. In con-
clusion, BiLSTM works by adding one extra layer of LSTM, causing
the information flow to travel in the other direction. It only denotes
that the input sequence runs in reverse at the next LSTM layer. Mul-
tiple operations, including averaging, summation, multiplication,
and concatenation, are then applied to the results of the two LSTM
layers. The gated design of Bi-LSTM and GRU networks solves
the disappearing gradient and exploding problems. A good way to
handle more long sequences is to use Bi-LSMT and GRU together.
GRU works well with datasets that don’t have text. In two to three
rounds, the complicated CNN+BiLSTM+GRU model learns the long
sequence of email text well. We have used word embedding, cnn,
bidirectional lstm and gru networks as our three building blocks
to separate email messages based on their sentiment and text’s
sequential features. Also, we succinctly demonstrate below why
these blocks help identify email spam:
•First, We have used the Sequence - to - sequence Lstm as the
current block in the networks since it can retrieve both the
previous and next sequences from the current. More so than
a straightforward LSTM network, it can also recognize and
extract text sentiment and sequential properties.
•Second, we extract the more complex and advanced charac-
teristics for Bi-LSTM network using Convolutional Network
block, which is the network’s second block after the Bi-LSTM
block. Bi-LSTM takes a long time to extract text-based fea-
tures, hence one of the reasons for using this block is to
reduce the network’s overall training time.
3 EXPERIMENTAL EVALUATION
3.1 Experimental Setup
We divided the information into training and testing groups of
80/20. We divided the remaining 20% of the 80 percent training
data into test data for the model. Construct, compute, and evaluate
the efficacy of the suggested method using the Pythonic packages
Keras, as TensorFlow and Scikit learn.
3.2 Dataset Description
Email spam detection is the foundation of this research project. The
dataset includes normal emails from the Enron corpora, deceptive
emails from phished email corpora, harassment emails chosen from
hate speech, and the offensive dataset. Only the content of the email
body is used for analysis; all header information, including sender,
topic, CC, and BCC, are eliminated. Word2vector, TF-IDF, and Word
Embedding are used to extract characteristics from the email mes-
sage and classify them. This dataset[ 8] is publicly available. The
presented model is implemented using Python, and several metrics,including accuracy, precision, and recall, are used to examine the
outcomes.
3.3 Evaluation Metrics and Results
Classifier performance is assessed Using metrics such as accuracy,
precision, and recall. Four terms make up a confusion matrix that
is used to calculate these metrics.
•True positives (TP) are positive values that have been accu-
rately assigned the positive label.
•The negative values that are accurately identified as negative
are known as True Negatives (TN).
•True Negative values are those that can be accurately identi-
fied as being negative (TN).
•Positive readings that have been mistakenly labeled as nega-
tive are known as False Negatives (FN).

Accuracy, Precision, and Recall metrics are computed. In the
given Table 1 where six different classifiers are Gaussian NB, Ran-
dom Forest, KNN, SVM, LSTM, and Propose Ensemble Hybrid
Model (CNN+BiLSTM+GRU) have been used in this work. In the
CNN, Bi-LSTM, and GRU architectures which enable sequence pre-
diction, CNN strands for feature extraction on data input which are
combined with LSTM. It requires less time training and a higher
expandable model. Any bottlenecks are created by predictions and
the increasing number of distinct units of information. This model
is useful for dealing with issue-related classifications that consist
of two or more than two classes. So suggested Ensemble model, out
of these six classifiers, produces more accurate findings.

3.4 Comparative Analysis
Amodel’s ability to fit new data is measured by the validation
loss, whereas its ability to fit training data is determined by the
training loss. The two main variables that decide whether in which
learning is efficient or not are validation loss and training loss.
LSTM and Suggested Ensemble hybrid Models have equivalent loss
and accuracy. In this context, we are contrasting the LSTM with the
proposed model (CNN, Bilstm, and GRU) in terms of their respective
validation accuracies and losses. The model’s accuracy was at its
highest after 14 epochs of operation when it achieved an accuracy
of roughly 97-98% while minimizing model loss.

decide on dense architecture as the final model for identifying the
text messages as spam or nonspam based on loss, accuracy, and the
aforementioned charts. The loss and accuracy over epochs are more
stable than LSTM, and the Proposed classifier has a straightforward
structure.
4 CONCLUSION
The model is composed of four networks Word-Embeddings, CNN,
Bi-LSTM, and GRU. We may train the model more quickly by using
the convolutional layer first, followed by the word-embedding layer,
and then the BiLSTM network. The Bidirectional LSTM network
also has higher-level properties that we can extract. We have used
a bidirectional LSTM(BiLSTM)and GRU network to memorize a
sentence’s contextual meaning and sequential structure, which im-
proves the model’s performance accuracy to roughly 97.32 percent.

Optimization under uncertainty ABSTRACT  
The Stochastic Subset Optimization (SSO) algorithm was proposed for optimal reliability problems that mini-
mizes the probability of system failure over the admissible space for the design parameters. It is based on the 
simulation of samples of the design parameters from an auxiliary Probability Density Function (PDF) and 
exploiting the information contained in these samples to identify subregions for the optimal design parameters 
within the original design space. This paper presents an improved version of SSO, named iSSO to overcome the 
shortcomings in the SSO. In the improved version, the Voronoi tessellation is implemented to partition the design 
space into non-overlapping subregions using the pool of samples distributed according to the auxiliary PDF. A 
double-sort approach is then used to identify the subregions for the optimal design. The iSSO is presented as a 
generalized design optimization approach primarily tailored for the stochastic structural systems but also 
adaptable to deterministic systems. Several optimization problems are considered to illustrate the effectiveness 
and efficiency of the proposed iSSO.   
1.Introduction 
Structural optimization may be defined as the rational establishment 
of an economical structural design with the available resources while 
satisfying specific performance criteria. In general terms, the economy 
may be characterized by minimum weight, minimum cost, maximum 
utility, or even minimum probability of failure. Broadly, structural 
optimization can be categorized into deterministic and stochastic opti-
mization [1,2]. The classical statement of unconstraint deterministic 
optimization is mathematically expressed as: 
minimize B
φ∃Φgφ (1)  
where, φφ1⋯φnφT∃Φ⊂Rnφ is a set of deterministic adjustable pa-
rameters that define the structural design, referred to herein as design 
parameters, gφBRnφ→R is the objective function to be minimized, and 
Φ denotes the bounded admissible design space. The deterministic 
constraints can be considered by the appropriate definition of the ad-
missible design space Φ for deterministic design parameters φ, as 
mentioned in [3]. In the deterministic structural optimization problem, 
the uncertainties in parameters are ignored, and fixed values are 
assumed for all the parameters. There are numerous optimizations approaches available in the literature, however, but it’s worth noting 
that no one-size-fits-all optimization approach is ideal for all sorts of 
problems [4–7]. The choice of optimization method is often determined 
by the specific characteristics of the problem, such as its complexity, 
dimensionality, constraints, and the nature of the objective function. As 
a result, there is always a scope for new approaches to be developed or 
the adaptation of existing methods to better suit specific problem clas-
ses. A detailed discussion of deterministic optimization approaches can 
be found in the literature [8,9]. 
In any practical situation, several parameters, such as loadings, 
structural parameters, geometric parameters, operation conditions, etc., 
are either not known at the design stage or are subjected to random 
fluctuations that give rise to performance variability and affect the 
performance of a system [10]. These parameters are characterized as 
uncertain parameters. Deterministic structural optimization discards the 
impact of uncertainty and can result in improper design. Therefore, it is 
desirable to account for the uncertainty in the parameters during opti-
mization by using the rational methods of probabilistic structural 
analysis [11]. Such structural optimization that accounts for un-
certainties is called stochastic optimization [12]. Although stochastic 
optimization refers to any method that employs randomness within 
some communities, in this paper, we will only consider settings where

2the objective function is random. Stochastic optimization or optimal 
design under uncertainty has been widely applied in many practical 
engineering fields, including civil engineering structures [13–15], 
composite structures [16,17], and vehicles [18,19]. 
Consider an engineering system that involves deterministic design 
parameters φ, and uncertain variables θθ1⋯θnθT∃Θ⊂Rnθ following 
a joint PDF p(θ|φ), where Θ denotes the parameter space of the uncer -
tain variables. The classical statement of stochastic optimization is 
mathematically expressed as: 
minimize B
φ∃ΦEθhφCθ (2)  
where, hφCθBRnθnφ→R is the structural performance function, and 
Eθ[ ⋅ ] denotes expectation with respect to the PDF for θ. Note that the 
objective function in the optimization problem in (2) is the expectation 
EθhφCθwhich is a deterministic function. It’s worth mentioning that 
stochastic optimization may also involve other stochastic measures such 
as variance or quantile values. However, these stochastic measures can 
rarely be evaluated analytically; therefore, several methods have been 
proposed for solving stochastic optimization problems. These special -
ized methods include, for example, sample average approximation, 
stochastic approximation, stochastic subset optimization, and ap-
proaches based on the use of Taylor series expansion [15,20,21], 
response surface, and metamodels [22–25]. Specific to structural engi-
neering, there are two broad categories of problems involving design 
optimization under uncertainty [26–35]: Reliability-Based Design 
Optimization (RBDO) and Robust Design Optimization (RDO). The 
objective of RBDO is to find an optimal solution that minimizes some 
deterministic, objective function under observance of probabilistic 
constraints instead of conventional deterministic constraints [36,37]. 
On the other hand, RDO aims to find an optimal solution that is insen -
sitive (or less sensitive) to input variations. It improves the design 
quality by minimizing performance variation without eliminating un-
certainty [29,38]. 
Taflanidis and Beck [39] introduced a novel algorithm for optimal 
reliability problem, the so-called SSO. SSO involves formulating an 
augmented problem where the design parameters are artificially 
considered uncertain and defining an auxiliary PDF that includes the 
structural performance function and the PDF of the uncertain variables. 
Next, SSO involves generating a pool of samples distributed according to 
this auxiliary PDF and identifying a subregion in the original design 
space, which, on average, improves the value of the objective function. 
By repeating this procedure several times, it is possible to determine at 
each step a smaller subregion in the design space, which in turn im-
proves the value of the objective function. Ultimately, this subregion 
will be sufficiently small to directly identify the optimal solution or 
provide sufficient information to launch another optimization algo-
rithm, such as the sample average approximation or stochastic approx -
imation. The implementation of the SSO method closely resembles the 
Subset Simulation (SS) algorithm [40] for reliability analysis. Since SSO 
is based on simulation, it can deal with linear or nonlinear problems and, 
at least theoretically, an unbounded number of design parameters. The 
numerical effort for solving a given optimization problem is indepen -
dent of the number of uncertain variables, and it grows linearly with the 
number of design parameters. 
Since the introduction of SSO, several extensions of SSO have been 
proposed. An extension of SSO termed Non-Parametric SSO, which 
adopts kernel density estimation to approximate the objective function, 
is presented in [41]. In [42], efficient integration of the Moving Least 
Squares approximation within SSO is introduced to reduce the compu -
tational effort in SSO. In [3], an augmented formulation is presented for 
the RDO of structures using SSO. SSO or its variants have also been 
applied to solve structural optimization problems. SSO has been used for 
reliability optimization and sensitivity analysis in system design in [39]. 
A framework for RDO of Tuned Mass Dampers (TMD) by SSO is dis-
cussed in [43]. Even though SSO has proved to be efficient for meeting various challenging optimization problems, it has two shortcomings. 
First, the effectiveness of SSO is dependent on the correct selection of 
the geometrical shape of the admissible subsets. Here, it is pertinent to 
mention that choosing a geometrical shape that effectively investigates 
the sensitivity of the objective function to each design variable is 
essential. The shapes, such as hyper-rectangle and hyper-ellipse are 
suggested in the literature for the admissible subsets. However, as shown 
later via the illustrative example, these shapes fail to include the optimal 
solution in cases with complex design spaces or problems with multiple 
optimal solutions. And second, identifying the optimal subset that con-
tains the smallest volume density involves a non-smooth optimization 
problem which is quite challenging. 
In this paper, an improved version of SSO is developed to overcome 
the shortcomings of the original SSO. This new version of the algorithm, 
as mentioned earlier, is named iSSO (improved SSO). Voronoi tessella -
tion is implemented to partition the design space into non-overlapping 
subregions (a set of Voronoi cells) using the pool of samples distrib -
uted according to the auxiliary PDF. The admissible set (a set of all 
admissible subregions) is then defined as a set containing all subsets of 
the set of Voronoi cells. This approach is able to capture the regions with 
lower objective function values even if they are disjointed or when the 
design space is complex. The details of the Voronoi tessellation are 
presented in Appendix A. A double-sort algorithm is then implemented 
to identify the optimal subset containing the smallest volume density. 
In the next section, the original SSO is reviewed. Section 3 presents 
the general theoretical and computational framework for the iSSO al-
gorithm. Section 4 considers several optimization problems to illustrate 
the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed iSSO algorithm. 
2.Original stochastic subset optimization 
In SSO, say at the i 1th iteration, the design space is represented by 
a subset I(i), where I(i) ∃I(i  1)⋅⋅⋅ ∃I(0) ∃Φ. Following the augmented 
formulation concept initially discussed in [44] for RBDO, the design 
parameters φ, are artificially considered uncertain variables with a 
prescribed PDF p(φ|I(i)) over the design space I(i) [45]. For convenience, 
p(φ|I(i)) 1/V(i) is considered, where V(i) is the volume of I(i). In this 
setting of the augmented stochastic design problem, the auxiliary PDF is 
defined as: 
π 
φCθ⃦⃦Ii)

φCθ⃦⃦Ii)
EφCθhsφCθ∝hφCθp 
φCθ⃦⃦Ii)
(3)  
where, p(φ, θ|I(i)) p(θ|φ)p(φ|I(i)). Note that if h(φ, θ)≼0, it must be 
suitably transformed to ensure that π(φ, θ|I(i)) ≽0. One way to do this is 
to define hs(φ,θ) h(φ, θ)  s, since Eθ[hs(φ,θ)] Eθ[h(φ,θ)]  s, that is, 
the two expected values differ only by a constant, and the optimization 
of the expected value of h( ⋅ ) is equivalent, in terms of the optimal design 
choice, to optimization for the expected value for hs( ⋅ ). In the above 
equation, the denominator is a normalizing constant given by: 
EφCθhφCθ̃

ΘhφCθp 
φCθ⃦⃦Ii)
dθdφB (4) 
Although this expected value is not explicitly needed, it can be 
determined using any state-of-the-art stochastic simulation method. The 
objective function EθhsφCθin this context of the auxiliary PDF is 
expressed as: 
EθhφCθπ 

The estimation of the marginal π(φ|I(i)) in (7) is necessary to mini-
mize J(φ|I(i)). Analytical approximations of π(φ|I(i)) based on kernel 
density approaches or the maximum entropy method might be arduous 
in case of complex problems, such as when design parameters nφ are 
large, or the sensitivity for some design parameters is complex [44]. In 
the SSO framework, such approximation of π(φ|I(i)) is avoided. In SSO, 
samples distributed as π(φ|I(i)) are obtained, and the information in 
these samples is exploited to identify a smaller subset of the design space 
with a high likelihood of containing the optimal design parameters. 
Samples distributed as π(φ, θ|I(i)) are obtained using any appropriate 
stochastic sampling algorithm, such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo 
(MCMC) sampling [46]. The φ component of these samples then cor-
responds to samples from the marginal distribution π(φ|I(i)). 
The sensitivity of objective function EθhsφCθto φ is determined by 
evaluating the average value (or equivalently volume density) of J(φ| 
I(i)) over any subset I in I(i), which is denoted by H(I) and defined as:

according to π(φ|I(i)) belonging to I(i), an estimate of H(I) is provided by: 
HINIEVI
NIiEVIiC (9)  
where, NIiis the number of samples distributed as π(φ|I(i)) belonging to 
I(i), and NI denotes the number of samples from π(φ|I(i)) belonging to the 
I (NIDNIi 1since I⊂I(k  1)). Say NIp0NIi 1. A smaller value of ρ re-
sults in a faster decrease in the size of the identified subsets but with 
poorer accuracy. The use of ρ equal to 0.1 - 0.2 is suggested in the 
literature [39]. 
A deterministic optimization, based on the estimate HIof H(I), is 
next performed to identify the subset I∃Ai1

admissible subsets in I(i), that contains the smallest volume density NI/

The effectiveness of SSO is dependent on the correct selection of the 
geometrical shape and size of the admissible subsets. Choosing a 
geometrical shape that effectively investigates the sensitivity of the 
objective function to each design variable is essential. The optimization 
in (10) determines the subset with the smallest average value of J(φ|I(i)) 
(or equivalently EθhsφCθ) within the admissible set Ai1
ρ. I(i 1) is a 
subset of the design space I(i) with a high likelihood of containing the 
optimal design parameters. The above steps are repeated until the 
stopping criterion is met. This way, SSO adaptively converges to a 
relatively small subregion within the original design space. The imple -
mentation of SSO is demonstrated in Fig. 1. The reader may refer to the 
original publication for a detailed explanation of SSO [39]. 
HIiexpresses the average relative sensitivity of Eθ[h(φ,θ)] to φ. A 
low value of HIiindicates that Eθ[h(φ,θ)] is more sensitive to φ, and 
vice versa. A high value of HIi, close to 1 corresponds to a sample 
density in design space I(i) that approximates a uniform distribution and 
suggests that the identified subset I(i) has a low likelihood of containing 
φ* [39]. Therefore, the SSO is stopped when HIiexceeds a threshold 
value. A threshold value of 0.75 –0.80 has been found to give satisfactory 
results [39]. 
3.Proposed approach 
In the proposed approach, the Voronoi tessellation is implemented to 
partition the design space into non-overlapping subregions (a set of 
Voronoi cells) using the pool of samples distributed according to this 
auxiliary PDF. Conceptually, Voronoi tessellation involves partitioning a 
space into convex polygons, called Voronoi cells, such that each cell 
contains exactly one sample, called a cell-generating sample. Every 
sample in a given polygon is closer to its generating sample compared to 
any other. In the proposed approach, the admissible set (a set of all 
admissible subspaces) is defined as a set containing all subsets of the set 
of Voronoi cells. An alternative approach to identify the optimal subset 
without performing any non-smooth deterministic optimization is also 
presented. The general theoretical and computational framework for the 
iSSO algorithm is presented in the following subsections, and the

Bansal                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Advances in Engineering Software 188 (2024) 103568

3.1. Partitioning of design space 
In the proposed approach, at the i 1th iteration, say N(i) is the 
number of samples distributed as π(φ|I(i)) belonging to the design space 
I(i). Let nvNiE1γ, γ ≽0 be the number of unique samples. If 
sampling techniques such as accept rejection, importance sampling, etc., 
are used, then γ 0, and each sample in the design space will be unique. 
However, if MCMC sampling techniques are used, the resulting samples 
will be correlated, that is γ F0, and we will have repeated samples. 
Assume that the design space I(i) is divided into vi
k, k 1⋅⋅⋅nv, Voronoi 
cells using nv unique samples, and say the Voronoi cell vi
k contains ηi

repeated samples, then, an estimate of π(φ|I(i)) is provided by: 
π 

k≽0C⊥φ∃vi
kC (11)  
where, Vi
k is the volume of the kth Voronoi cell. Obviously, ⨄
Iiπφ†Ii
dφ1. 
Similar to the original SSO, the sensitivity of the objective function J 
(φ|I(i)) to φ is determined by evaluating the average value of J(φ|I(i)) 
over any subspace I of the design space I(i). Subset I is any subset of 
nvVoronoi cells (these cells may be disjointed). Since the design space is 
partitioned into nv subspaces or Voronoi cells, the number of admissible 
subsets (proper subsets) is given by 2nν 1. Based on the estimate 
πφ†Iiprovided in (11), an estimate of H(I) is provided as:

onoi cells defining the subset I. Note that the parentheses are used in the

B (13)  3.2. Identification of an optimal subset 
A deterministic optimization needs to be performed to identify a 
subset I that contains the smallest volume density NI/VI. In the case of 
unique samples, since ηi
⋅1, the solution to the minimization problem 
in (10) is a set of ρN(i) Voronoi cells with the largest volume. For the case 
with repeated samples, the optimization can be performed using 
methods appropriate for non-smooth optimization problems, such as 
sub-gradient methods, bundle methods, gradient sampling methods, etc. 
In this study, we propose an alternative approach to identify the 
optimal subset without performing any non-smooth deterministic opti-
mization. A double-sort algorithm is proposed, which involves sorting 
the Voronoi cells in ascending order of the sample counts and then in 
groups of cells with the same sample count in descending order of cell 
volume. Finally, the top cells containing ρN(i)samples are selected as an 
approximate optimal solution from the sorted list. 
One may argue that the optimal subset can be obtained by first 
sorting the Voronoi cells in ascending order of the cell density, defined 
as ηi
kEVi
k, and then by selecting the top cells containing ρN(i) samples 
from the sorted list. However, this argument is erroneous because the 
objective is to minimize ⋃S

effectiveness of the proposed double-sort algorithm is demonstrated in 
Section 4 with the help of examples. 
3.3. Simulation of conditional samples 
At the i 1th iteration, ρN(i) samples distributed as π(φ|I(i 1)) are 
available from the previous iteration. Using these samples as seeds, 
additional (1  ρ)N(i 1) are simulated. The proposed method to 
simulate additional samples involves two steps: (a) randomly selecting a 
Voronoi cell within the subset I(i 1) based on the estimate πφ†Iiand 
(b) applying the Metropolis-Hastings algorithm within the selected 
Voronoi cell.

5To simulate a new sample within a selected Voronoi cell, the sample 
that generated the selected Voronoi cell or the last simulated sample in 
the selected Voronoi cell is used as the seed sample, and the Metropolis- 
Hastings algorithm is implemented. A candidate sample [φc,θc] is 
simulated using the proposal q(φc,θc|φ,θ) and is accepted with the 
probability min(1, a0), where, a0 is given as: 
a0hφcCθcpφcCθcqφCθ†φcCθc
hφCθpφCθqφcCθc†φCθB (15) 
In the present study, the proposed PDF is equal to the uniform PDF 
for design parameters and the initial PDF for uncertain variables, i.e., q 
(φ, θ|φc,θc) p(φ, θ). Therefore, on simplifying (15), a0 is given as: 
a0hφcCθc
hφCθB (16)  
3.4. Stopping criteria 
A new stopping criterion is proposed in this study. The convergence 
of the expected value of the performance measure h(φ, θ) with respect to 
the PDF for φ and θ in consecutive iterations is used as the stopping 
criterion. Mathematically the proposed stopping criterion is represented 
by: 
⃦⃦EφCθhφCθi EφCθhφCθi 1⃦⃦≼ε (17)  
where, ε is a user-specified tolerance limit. Other stopping criteria, as 
indicated in [39,47], can also be chosen. 3.5. Implementation issues 
An important issue for the effective implementation of the iSSO is the 
creation of the Voronoi cells at the current iteration bounded within the 
Voronoi cell created at the previous iterations. Although it is possible to 
create such bounded Voronoi cells, due to the geometrical complexities, 
it is usually unfeasible for the higher dimensional problems (nφF2). An 
alternative approach is proposed in the present study for creating the 
Voronoi cells at any iteration of the iSSO. The proposed approach in-
volves creating Voronoi cells using the samples generated at the current 
and all previous iterations and then by considering Voronoi cells cor-
responding to the samples from the current iteration. This is shown in 
Fig. 3, where Fig. 3(a) shows the N samples at the first iteration and the 
corresponding Voronoi cells. Fig. 3(b) shows the ρN selected Voronoi 
cells leading to the smallest volume density and the additional (1  ρ)N 
samples being generated using these ρN samples as seeds. Fig. 3(c) 
shows that the Voronoi cells are generated using all N (1  ρ)N 
samples that are generated in the two iterations. The Voronoi cells 
corresponding to the N samples for consideration at the second iteration 
are also highlighted in Fig. 3(c). Fig. 3(d) shows a zoomed-in version of 
Fig. 3(c) where it can be observed that the area covered by the N Voronoi 
cells considered in the second iteration is not the same as the area 
covered by the ρN Voronoi cells selected in the first iteration. On the 
contrary, the area covered by the Voronoi cells in the second iteration is 
more than the area covered by the Voronoi cells corresponding to the 
seed samples from the first iteration. This is because a new sample 
within the Voronoi cell between an existing sample and the existing 
Voronoi cell edge results in the relocation of the Voronoi cell edge in a

Bansal                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Advances in Engineering Software 188 (2024) 103568
6direction away from the new sample. The increase at each iteration in-
troduces a bias in the estimate of π(φ|I(i)) in (11). However, this does not 
affect the performance of the proposed approach as the objective is not 
to simulate the samples distributed as π(φ|I(i)) but to identify the subsets 
for an optimal solution. In addition, the increase is not substantial, as 
seen later in the illustrative examples in Section 4. 
3.6. Special case: deterministic optimization 
In the iSSO framework, a deterministic optimization problems can 
also be handled with the vector of uncertain variables θ set equal to a 
null vector (nθ 0). Since the determination of the subset at each iSSO 
iteration is solely dependent on the samples distributed as π(φ), no 
modification to the iSSO algorithm is required to solve a deterministic 
optimization problem, and the entire formulation remains valid. 
4.Illustrative examples 
In this section, typical optimization problems are considered to 
demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed approach. 
First, deterministic optimization problems are considered. These prob-
lems include several local and global minima. Next, stochastic optimi -
zation problems are illustrated. The second example presents an RDO 
problem of the TMD. In this example, the variance minimization of the 
protected structure ’s displacement (TMD attached to the structure) is performed. In the third example, the mean minimization of 120 bars 
truss problems is explored to demonstrate the applicability of the pro-
posed approach to a high-dimensional stochastic design problem. 
Finally, the fourth example investigates the reliability-based optimiza -
tion of a base isolation system for a 10-story building. 
In this study, after implementing iSSO, the optimal design solution is 
identified as follows. Let θj, j 1⋅⋅⋅n be a set of independent, identically 
distributed realizations of θ, and let h(φ, θj) be the structural perfor -
mance function realization for θj. The expected structural performance 
function is approximated by the average of the realizations as: 
EθhφCθ≪1

EθhφCθis evaluated for all unique φ samples obtained at the last 
iteration of the iSSO, and the φ sample resulting in the smallest value of 
EθhφCθis taken as the optimal solution. Alternatively, as the right- 
hand side of (18) is deterministic, any deterministic optimization 
method can also be used to solve the optimization problem with the 
approximate expectation. 
In the following examples, both iSSO and SSO are implemented with 
N 1000 nφ, ρ 0.20 and the stopping criteria as stated in (17). Here, a 
value of ε 10 3 is adopted.

The results for the Griewank function are presented in Fig. 4. Fig. 4(a, 
b) shows that the function has multiple closely spaced local minima with 
a single global minimum. Fig. 4(c, d) shows the SSO optimization using 
hyper-rectangle and hyper-ellipse as shapes of admissible subsets. It is 
seen that these shapes fail to capture the region containing the optimal 
design due to the presence of multiple local minima. Next, the iSSO is 
implemented, where the Voronoi cells selected at the first and last 
iteration are shown in Fig. 4(e, f). It is observed that at the first iteration, 
the selected Voronoi cells effectively capture both the local and global 
minima and in the subsequent iterations, the selected cells are more 
concentrated near the global minimum. The region selected at the last 
iteration captures the optimal global solution. 
The Cross-in-Tray function has a relatively complex design space 
compared to the Griewank function. Fig. 5(a, b) shows multiple local 
and global minima. Minimization by using SSO is demonstrated in Fig. 5 
(c, d). It is found that both the hyper-rectangle and hyper-ellipse are 
trapped around any one of the global minima. At the same time, the iSSO 
is able to capture the regions that include all of the global minima, as 
Fig. 5.Results for the Cross-in-Tray function.  M.A. Khalid and S. Bansal                                                                                                                                                                                                                   Advances in Engineering Software 188 (2024) 103568
8seen in Fig. 5(e, f). 
The Holder Table function has multiple local and global minima; the 
global minima are placed at the boundary of the design space, as shown 
in Fig. 6(a, b). Once again, it is seen that both the hyper-rectangle and 
hyper-ellipse are trapped around any of one of the global minima, and 
on the other hand, the iSSO is able to capture the regions that include all 
of the global minima, as seen in Fig. 6(e, f). 
The results from the three examples demonstrate that the proposed 
iSSO is able to capture the regions containing the optimal solution 
effectively. 
Next, the statistics of the results of 50 independent runs, both for SSO 
and iSSO are presented in Table 1. It also includes the results obtained by 
using state-of-the-art approaches, such as the Genetic algorithm, particle 
swarm optimization, and the gradient based optimization approach 
(interior-point algorithm). The proposed iSSO outperforms all other 
approaches as more successes in determining the optimal solution are 
observed in all three optimization problems. It is also seen that both SSO 
and iSSO result in a similar value of volume reduction for the same 
stopping criterion; however, with SSO, the number of iterations required 
to achieve this volume reduction are relatively higher. The proposed 
approach outperformed the state-of-the-art approaches, as indicated by 
the number of successes. These examples demonstrate that the main 
advantage of implementing Voronoi tessellation is an effective explo -
ration of the design space. 
Next, the performance of the proposed "double sort algorithm" for 
selecting the optimal subset is studied by using the above-mentioned three functions. Fig. 7 shows the value of HI1for the 50 indepen -
dent simulation runs, which is estimated by implementing the proposed 
double sort algorithm and by using the Genetic algorithm. It can be 
noted that for each run, the HI1values obtained using the proposed 
double sort algorithm and Genetic algorithm are well matched, thereby 
confirming the adequacy of the proposed double sort algorithm. 
At any iteration of iSSO, new samples are simulated using the seed 
samples. In the proposed approach, the volume of the Voronoi cells 
corresponding to the seed and new samples is greater than the volume of 
the Voronoi cells corresponding only to the seed samples. Fig. 8 shows 
this change in volume Vseedsnew Vseeds
Vseeds due to the creation of Voronoi cells 
at any generation of iSSO using the procedure mentioned in Section 3.4. 
The increase is observed to be small which further reduces with an in-
crease in the iteration number. It is also observed that the increase in 
volume decreases with an increase in sample size at each iteration and 
increases with an increase in the dimension of the problem. 
4.2. Robust design optimization of the tuned mass damper 
This example considers a stochastic design problem involving a 
Tuned Mass Damper (TMD) attached to a Single Degree of Freedom 
(SDOF) system. The problem is taken from [48] and is shown in Fig. 9. 
In this problem, the system is excited by a white noise signal with a 
mean zero and unit variance. The performance measure is the variance 
of the displacement of the system σ2
xs. The mass mS, stiffness kS, and

9damping cS of the system are taken as uncertain parameters, following 
independent Gaussian distribution. The mean value of these variables is 
taken to be 105 kg, 107 N/m, and 4 ×104 Ns/m respectively. To account 
for uncertainty, the c.o.v value for each variable taken is 0.05. The 
frequency ratio βωTEωS and damping ξT of the TMD are considered 
design parameters. The TMD has a mass ratio, mT/ms, of 0.10. The parameters mT,ωT,andωS are, in order, the mass of the TMD, the natural

Table 2 presents the optimal design parameter values as well as the 
objective function value that solve the optimization problem in (22). 
Results obtained using SSO, Sample Average Approximation (SAA), and iSSO are shown. SAA is applied with a sample size of 103, as mentioned 
in [43]. The results demonstrate that iSSO is effective in locating the 
optimal solution. SSO implemented with hyper-ellipse gives an optimal 
solution but has a higher computational cost. 
4.3. 120-bars truss structure 
The third example involves minimizing the mean of the compliance 
of a 120-bar linear elastic truss structure shown in Fig. 10 under the 
weight constraint W ≼15, 000kg. Because of structural symmetry, 
design parameters corresponding to the cross-sectional areas of elements 
are divided into seven groups, each with a minimum area of 10 4 m2. 
The Young ’s modulus for the bar groups are assumed as uncorrelated 
normal random variables with mean values equal to 210 GPa and the c. 
o.v equal to 0.10 respectively. The density of the material is 7971.89 kg/ 
m3. The dome is subjected to concentrated vertical loads acting down -
ward at the top node, normally distributed with a mean equal to 60 kN 
and c.o.v equal to 0.20. In addition, the mass of bars is concentrated at 
the nodes. The problem is taken from [48]. 
Table 3 presents the best of 10 independent run results obtained with 
SSO and iSSO. Once again, the SSO and iSSO solutions agree well, 
thereby demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed approach. At 
the same time, the number of function evaluations is substantially less in 
the case of iSSO, indicating the efficiency of the proposed approach.

11optimization of a base-isolation system attached to a 10-story building 
as shown in Fig. 11. This optimization problem includes maximizing the

in this problem h(φ, θ) IF(φ,θ). 
The 10-story building is considered as a shear structure with un-
certain inter-story stiffness and damping. Each story has a total mass of 
207 ton. The inter-story stiffness ki of all stories are parameterized by ki

The damping ratios are considered independent Gaussian variables 
with mean values of 0.025 and c.o.v of 0.10 for all modes. The Kanai-

where, ωg, ζgand σω are the resonant frequency, damping, and RMS of the 
acceleration input of the filter, respectively. These are also considered 
uncertain variables with mean values of [2πrad/s, 0.5, 0.2g] and a c.o.v 
equal to 0.20. The non-stationarity of the excitation is modeled by 
multiplying the filter output with the envelope function as:

with parameters λ1 1.25, λ2 0.2 and λ3 0.353 chosen to simulate 
strong earthquake excitation for a duration of 40 s with a sampling time 
of 0.02 s. The base-isolation system considered is a lead–rubber bilinear 
isolator with an additional viscous damper. The base has a 247-ton mass. 
The design parameters φ for the base isolation structure system are the 
stiffness before yielding Kprand after yielding Kp, the yield force is Fy, 
and the damping coefficient cd. The reader may refer to [39,50] for 
additional details regarding the base isolation structure system adopted 
in this study. 
Failure is indicated when any of the normalized base displacements 
or inter-story drifts exceeds unity. The normalization constants are 0.5 m 
and 0.033 m respectively. The design interval for each variable is 
specified as Kpr [50, 600] MN/m, Fy [1, 8] MN, Kp [5, 60] MN/m, 
and cd [0.1, 10]MNs/m. In this example, iSSO and SSO are imple -
mented with six number of iterations. 
Table 4 shows the optimization results for the best 10 independent 
simulation runs. The comparison of the results obtained using SSO, SAA 
(with a sample size of 103), and iSSO shows that the optimal design 
obtained using the proposed approach iSSO is in good agreement. The 
failure probability of the structure is reduced from 0.95 (without the 
base isolation system) to 0.0326 after installing the optimally designed 
base isolation system. 
5.Conclusion 
This study attempts to provide an optimization approach called 
"iSSO", which is an improved version of SSO, primarily for stochastic 
optimization problems while it retains utility for deterministic optimi -
zation problems as well. Two novel ideas are introduced in this study: 
first, a better characterization of the design space is offered by parti-
tioning the design space into non-overlapping subregions using Voronoi 
Fig. 11.(left) 10-story base isolated shear model, and (right) force-deformation of bilinear isolator [49].

12tessellation which improves the effectiveness and efficiency of the pro-
posed iSSO considerably in comparison to SSO. Second, a novel "double 
sort" approach is proposed, eliminating the need for optimization to 
identify the subregions for the optimal design at each iSSO iteration. 
Several mathematical and engineering design examples, including TMD, 
120 bars truss structure, and base-isolated structure, are included in this 
study to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed iSSO. The results show 
that the proposed iSSO effectively identifies the reduced design space for 
complex design problems with multiple global and local minima. This is 
attributable to the Voronoi tessellation, which eliminates the require -
ment of the presumed admissible design space form to resemble the 
contour of the original design. Voronoi tessellation enabled better 
design space exploration, allowing multiple global minima scattered 
throughout the design pace to be effectively identified. Due to the dis-
cretization of the design space via Voronoi tessellation, computation 
demand is significantly reduced as the number of function evaluations 
for all examples is lower vis-a-vis the original SSO. Moreover, the novel 
idea of the double sort approach achieves the requisite precision in 
identifying the subregions for optimal solutions and makes iSSO 
implementation simple and effective. 
The applicability of the approach is dependent on the creation of the Voronoi cells. At present the methods available in the literation for 
creating the Voronoi tessellation are computationally demanding when 
considering problems of very high dimension. Future work will focus on 
developing a method for creating the Voronoi tessellation in higher di-
mensions, particularly those greater than ten.

Appendix-A: Voronoi Tessellation 
Voronoi tessellation is a mathematical concept named after the Russian mathematician Georgy Voronoi. It is also known as the Voronoi diagram or 
Dirichlet tessellation. A Voronoi tessellation of a set of points P in a plane is a partition of the plane into a set of non-overlapping convex polygons, with 
each polygon including precisely one point of P and each point in a polygon being closer to its associated point in P than to any other point in P. Each 
polygon is referred to as a Voronoi cell or a Dirichlet region. The boundary of each cell is constituted of points that are equidistant to two or more 
points in P. Fig. 12 shows the Voronoi diagram in a two-dimensional design space.
Fig. 12.Voronoi diagram in 2-dimensional space.  
There are several efficient algorithms for creating Voronoi diagrams. One such basic algorithm is to start with a set of points and then compute the 
Voronoi cells by dividing the space into regions based on the distance to the nearest point. The Bowyer-Watson algorithm [51], which generates a 
Delaunay triangulation in any number of dimensions, can be applied while creating a Voronoi diagram. The Delaunay triangulation is a triangulation 
of the point in which no point falls within the circumcircle of any triangle. The polygon generated by the intersection of the half-planes defined by the 
edges of the Delaunay triangles enclosing the point is therefore obtained as the Voronoi cell of a point. 
It can be summarized that Voronoi tessellation is a powerful mathematical concept that aids in dividing space into regions based on the distance to 
a set of points. Voronoi tessellation finds widespread applications in areas such as image processing [52], spatial topology analysis [53], and 
microstructure study [52]. The MATLAB command "Voronoin " from the "Parallel Computing Toolbox " [54] has been used in this study to create the 
Voronoi cells.
